1:To be, or not to be: that is the question:
2:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
3:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
5:And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
7:The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
10:To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
13:Must give us pause: there's the respect
15:For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
16:The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
17:The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
18:The insolence of office and the spurns
19:That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
23:But that the dread of something after death,
24:The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
25:No traveller returns, puzzles the will
26:And makes us rather bear those ills we have
27:Than fly to others that we know not of?
29:And thus the native hue of resolution
30:Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
32:With this regard their currents turn awry,
33:And lose the name of action. - Soft you now!
34:The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
